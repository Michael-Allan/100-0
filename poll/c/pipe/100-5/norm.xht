        The principles are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate personal action to an ultimate end</dd>
        <dt><dfn>M2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        For my part, I take these two principles to be sufficient for moral judgement.
        Whatever obeys them, I judge to be right; whatever counters them, wrong.
        Right (in the moral sense, viz. what ought to be) consists in obedience to both principles together,
        while wrong consists in countering either, or both.
        Whatever neither obeys nor counters, I judge to be neither right nor wrong.
        </p>
    <p>
        That’s for my part.  For yours, you might conclude that M1 and M2 are insufficient
        or even unnecessary for moral judgement.  I can offer no general proof to the contrary.
        My only intention here (as a practitioner, not a theorist) is to convince you
        that both principles are well fitted to their postulates and useful for structural purposes.
        People can build sturdy things with them.

    <p>
        The postulates are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>I value reason the most</dd>

        I'll explain what I mean by this value I place on reason.  First, I appreciate its steadfast work.
        Reason always works to find meaning and coherence in the world of experience,
        trying hard to fit each effect with its cause and each means with its end.
        <!--
        - reason informs my view of all things
            - whether looking backward or forward
            - nothing seems able to replace it
            -->
        It works diligently, trying all ways to make progress, never quitting one way except to try another.
        It is one of those rare things in life that I can safely rely on.  Or so I feel.
        </p>
    <p>
        I can also share in it.  I can experience reason working in me.
        I can even, on occaision, and with joy,
        <q>triumph o’er a secret wrung from nature’s close reserve</q>.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Bro55' id='Bro55qTG'>Bro55</a>]</sup>
        This makes me grateful to those in the past who carried reason forward with them,
        and hopeful for those in the future who, in their own capacity, may carry it further.
        </p>
    <p>
        But whatever my motive, however I came to value reason, I posit that I hold most tightly to it.
        I would do anything rather than see it fail or be diminished.

    <h2><a href='#Form'>Justifying the moral form by its material fitness</a></h2>
    <p>
        Here I make a practical argument in support of the two formal principles.
        I can’t offer a complete theory.  I don’t know whether it’s because I’m unskilled as a theoretician,
        or because the task is not proper to theory (or because my conclusions are ultimately wrong),
        but I’m unable to contrive a logical argument to derive the formal principles from the material.
        Regardless of their source, therefore, I begin simply by positing them: <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#SF' id='SF-a'>SF</a>]</sup>

        Suppose (for sake of the argument) that M1 and M2 are introduced to modern society
        and made integral to its structure.  Whether by tradition, institution,
        private or public dissemination, their effects (imagine) are pervasive and strong.
        They’re a part of the social fabric.
        </p>
    <p>
        Later I’ll claim the feasibility of such an introduction.
        In this section, I claim only its fitness.
        I’ll argue that M1 and M2 together are exactly fit to the purpose of M0.
        Like a perfectly tailored suit [of formal wear|dress], nothing remains to be cut from the material
        and no obvious alteration would improve its fit.  (And it beats going naked.)
        This won’t prove, of course, that it’s the best possible suit [to wear] for the occaision.
        There may be other combinations of formal principles that exactly fit the purpose
        ([in the sense of] defying any easy alteration) and there may be one that better furthers it.

        Only a general theory could prove otherwise.  Lacking that theory,
        I base my argument on the one, particular combination that appears to fit.

            <span>(matter and form)</span> This fashion of relating matter and form was suggested
            by my reading of Kant’s <i>Groundwork</i>.
            <q>All rational cognition is either <i>material</i> and considers some object,
            or <i>formal</i> and occupied merely with the form of the understanding and of reason itself,
            and with the universal rules of thinking as such, regardless of differences among its objects.</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#AA' id='AA-a'>AA</a>, <a href='#Kan85' id='Kan85q4:387'>4:387</a>]</sup>
            <p>
                See also where he considers the question in <i>Toward perpetual peace</i>,
                <q>whether… one should start from the material principle of practical reason,
                the end (as the object of choice), or rather start from its formal principle…
                (whatever the end may be).</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan95' id='Kan95q8:376-8'>8:376-8</a>]</sup>

            <span>(physics and ethics)</span> This unlikely juxtaposition of physics and ethics
            brings to mind Kant’s intimation, quoted famously as his epitaph,
            <q>Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence,
            the more often and more steadily one reflects on them:
            the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan88' id='Kan88q5:161'>5:161</a>]</sup>

            <span>(sources of form)</span>  History gave me M2.  It’s explicit in modern society.
            I could almost copy it down verbatim.
            <p>
                I could also get M1 from history if I were to analyze the religious roots and utopian tradition
                of my culture.  In fact I got it by analyzing M0.  Cutting away its particulars
                I uncovered an M1-like form.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#MF' id='MF-a'>MF</a>]</sup>
                It was a late discovery; I never thought to cut the traditional material in this way.
