        The principles are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate personal action to an ultimate end</dd>
        <dt><dfn>M2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        For my part, I take these two principles to be sufficient for moral judgement.
        Whatever obeys them, I judge to be right; whatever counters them, wrong.
        Right (in the moral sense, viz. what ought to be) consists in obedience to both principles together,
        while wrong consists in countering either, or both.
        Whatever neither obeys nor counters, I judge to be neither right nor wrong.
        </p>
    <p>
        That’s for my part.  For yours, you might conclude that M1 and M2 are insufficient
        or even unnecessary for moral judgement.  I won’t argue otherwise here.
        My only intention is to convince you that both principles are well fitted to their postulates
        and useful for structural purposes.  People can build sturdy things with them.

    <h2><a href='#Form'>Justifying the moral form by its material fitness</a></h2>
    <p>
        Here I make an argument in support of the two formal principles.
        I begin by simply positing them: <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#OF' id='OF-a'>OF</a>]</sup>
        </p>

            <tr>
                <td>matter</td>
                <td>M0</td>
                <td>
                    I desire the endless continuity of rational being
                    that is made feasible by the limit of light speed
                    </td>
                <td>end</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    <p>
        Now I ask you to imagine the formal practice.
        Therefore suppose that M1 and M2 are introduced to modern society.
        Suppose they become integral to its structure.  Whether by tradition, institution,
        private or public dissemination, their effects (imagine) are made pervasive and strong.
        They become a part of the social fabric.
        </p>
    <p>
        Later I’ll argue for the feasibility of such an introduction.
        In this section, I argue only for its fitness.
        I claim that M1 and M2 together fit the purpose of M0 exactly.
        Like a perfectly tailored suit of formal wear, nothing remains to be cut from the material
        and no obvious alteration would improve its fit.  (And it beats going naked.)
        This cannot prove, of course, that it’s the best possible suit [to wear] for the occaision.
        There may be other combinations of formal principles with an exact fit to the purpose
        ([in the sense of] defying any easy alteration) and there may be one that better furthers it.
        <!--
        - footnote to further illustrate mode of argument
            - metaphor of fitness landscape
            - hills (fit) and valleys (unfit)
            - argument tells that form is hill
                - not that form is only hill (the only fit form) nor tallest hill (the best fit)
            -->
        I have no proof against that possibility.
        But here I have a combination that fits (ready to wear) and I base my argument on it.

            <span>(matter and form)</span> This fashion of relating matter and form was suggested
            by my reading of Kant’s <i>Groundwork</i>.
            <q>All rational cognition is either <i>material</i> and considers some object,
            or <i>formal</i> and occupied merely with the form of the understanding and of reason itself,
            and with the universal rules of thinking as such, regardless of differences among its objects.</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#AA' id='AA-a'>AA</a>, <a href='#Kan85' id='Kan85q4:387'>4:387</a>]</sup>
            <p>
                See also his later consideration of the question in <i>Toward perpetual peace</i>,
                <q>whether… one should start from the material principle of practical reason,
                the end (as the object of choice), or rather start from its formal principle…
                (whatever the end may be).</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan95' id='Kan95q8:376-8'>8:376-8</a>]</sup>

            <span>(origin of form)</span> It isn’t important to the argument (which just posits them),
            but sometimes I reflect on the origin of the formal principles.
            I think history must have given me M2.  It’s explicit in modern society.
            I could almost copy it verbatim.
            <p>
                I could get M1 too from history
                if I were to analyze the religious roots and utopian tradition of my culture.
                In fact I got it by analyzing M0.  Cutting away its particulars
                I uncovered an M1-like form.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#MF' id='MF-a'>MF</a>]</sup>
                So it was a late discovery; I never thought before to cut the traditional material in this way.
