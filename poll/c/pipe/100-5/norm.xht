            - I infer a *moral matter* that comprises fear and devotion in lockstep with the demands of reason
        - analyzing this matter on historical lines
            - I abstract two forms that are essential to it:
            - a pre-modern one of *goal orientation|direction*
            - and a modern one of *promoting freedom*
        - finally
            - I show how these same two forms that shape the internal, moral matter are likewise fit to shape
              the external, structural means to the future, stable end

                    - elsewhere I express the moral *forms* in terms of virtue
                        - but the matter behind my unquestioned choice doesn't feel like a virtue
                        ( note
                            - see <a href='formal-inflection'>formal inflection</a>
                    - I can hardly imagine anyone choosing otherwise
                    - therefore whatever motivated my choice is probably too common to call a virtue

                ii. deontological ethics
                    - but again, this seems unpromising
                    - again, I *do* express the moral forms in imperative terms
                        - but the matter behind my unquestioned choice doesn't feel like obedience
                          to any duty, law or command
                    - I can hardly imagine a willing *dis*obedience

                iii. consequentialism
                    - it *does* seem a consequential choice
                        - and it always did
                    - whether I view it subjectively
                        - attuned to how it affects *me*
                        - or objectively
                        - calculating how it affects people at large
                        - it seems to carry|entail the heaviest of consequences
                    - this is my initial warrant to call it a matter of morals
                        ( to which I'll implicitly add the warrant of duck typing

                    - continuing jejunely on this conventional path

            - I never had to ask [myself] this question before
            - society shaped me - in the sense that I mean here
            - why I don't know
                - for I never asked either what lay behind its shaping
                - what material cause
            - now a cause comes to me unbidden and I see that it's something new
            - it behoves me to ask
                - what shape shall I *now* take?

                d) each is clearly formulated
                e) both are mutually compatible

        - already F∼ is roughly formulated above
        - next I want G∼
        - it's exposed on the surface of M
            - (which allows | allowing) me to isolate it by simple erasure
        - erasing all but the iconically medieval parts [\of M] yields:
          "In continual fear... I... reaffirm my devotion to... unbroken continuity"
        - abstraction eliminates the material particulars to reveal the form:

    <h2><a href='#Fitness'>Imagining trials of structural fitness under load</a></h2>
    <pre>
        [ headquote
            - early bridge failures
                - Victorian Britain I think
            - common enough (I read) that engineers kept score (?) of each others' fallen bridges
                - read ∼2001 in book from engineering library
            = source

        - one way to gain a deeper understanding of things
            - is to (break them | see them [break, or lying] broken) | see them break)
        - to do that
            - I now extend the scope of formal fitness (validity of form)
            - beyond the hylomorphic analysis of the previous section
            - to include artificial causation
        - here I view the forms
            - not as abstractions after the fact of the moral matter
            - but as the means to [realize] the moral end (table above)
                = note
                    - Kant also has matter as 'end',[4:436] though didn't see where he speaks of 'means'
                    ( unsure how I got idea for this type of relation, which is reason for this note
        - this introduces a criterion of means-end coherence
            - I expect the combined forms (G, F)
                - to maximize the probability of securing the unbroken continuity of rational being (M)
        - by analogy with structural engineering
            - I call this newly introduced criterion a 'load' or 'stress'
            - on the composite 'structure' of the forms
        - I investigate what happens to that load (the end)
            - when I forcefully deform, reform or otherwise 'break' the structure that supports it (the means)

        - I'll explain more about the trial method as the trials proceed
        - meantime
            - load applied
            - I start breaking things:
        </pre>
    <dl id='G-ko' class='symbolic'>
        <dt>G′ko</dt>
        <dd>
            <del>Relating the personal to the endmost goal of the person</del>
            </dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - G′ko [completely] knocks G (out of | from) the structure
        - F alone remains
        [ direct argument
            - G′ko means
                - no structural support for goal orientation
                - no expectation that people are trying to achieve anything at all
                    - as per status quo, today
                    - out of sight, out of mind
            - that seems to decrease the likelihood|probability of the deliberate attainment of ends
                - not only [the attainment of] ends in general
                - but *en passant* the specific end of M
            - ∴ G′ko reduces means-end coherence
            - the structure is sagging here
                - not [confidently] carrying the full load

        [ indirect argument
            - I look at the sagging structure with alarm
            - I inspect it more closely
            - it's not unusual for me to be alarmed
                - about [the vulnerability of] F∼ [on the slightest provocation]
            - I'm quick to suspect that it's in [imminent] danger of collapse
            - balanced against this suspicion
                - I can usually weigh several centuries of successful institution
                - that show no evidence of instability
                - (or none that I'm aware of)
                - and that'll be enough to temper my alarm
            - but now there's a difference
            - signs of strain in the structure
            - direct my thoughts back to the load it bears
            - I think [a time span of] a few centuries is irrelevant to a load of this nature
            - it's not the time *since* F∼'s institution that matters [here]
                - but the [prior] time to achieve that institution [in the first place]
                - and, above all, the time [hence] to achieve the material end

            - differences that come with lengthened prospect:
                - underlines[?] importance of F∼
                    - hard won institution of F∼ [we have] may be the last (we ever see | there ever is)
                    - to lose it might leave us no means whatsoever to reach the material end
                - lifts the likelihood of unlikely events
                - dangers that formally lay below|beyond|outside
                    - the horizon|bounds [of prudence|probability]
                    - now rise|appear as structural design constraints
            - lengthening the prospect elevates my usual worry and enlarges its danger
            - I sketch that danger in outline:

                1) a weakening of the institution of F∼ owing to a series of changes
                    - each the deliberate act of a legitimate authority in response to the pressure of events
                2) a shock to the now weakened structure|institution
                    - whether internal or external in origin
                    - that imposes great|extreme, unforseen stress
                3) failure of the structure

            - enshrined alone
                - as freedom for its own sake
                - F∼ may be [dangerously] unstable in the long term|prospect
            - one way to counter that instability
                - is to stiffen the institution of F∼ against the gradual weakening of (1)
                - so that it's better prepared to handle the sudden stress of (2)
            - a key problem for the design of the stiffener
                - is that the [basic|original problem of] weakening is the consequence of step-wise changes
                    - each in itself warranted by a (state of affairs | situation) [that is] unknown
                      to the designer
                - it would be counterproductive to block any change where the warrant is valid
                    - viz. where the change would be beneficial in the end, all things considered
            - accordingly the best design I can think of would depend on these four structural elements:

                a) freedom of speech
                b) a politics accountable to the public (e.g. a broad electorate)
                c) a general habit of possessing an endmost goal
                d) a general habit of relating one's action to one's endmost goal

            - if you sometimes feel that grandeurized|grand visions of utopian ends
                - pose the greatest danger to freedom
                    = tie this explicitly to Berlin
                        ( either his essay on "two freedoms", or on the "decline of utopian ideas"
                        ( referent/1978, Berlin. The decline of utopian ideas in the West.*
                - then think of (c, d) as the structural elements of a general inoculation
                    - against the infectious allure of such visions
                  / = note
                  /     - think how much less a workers' paradise on earth
                  /         - or a thousand-year Reich
                  /         - could take hold in a medieval imagination
                  /         - already habituated to contemplating the eternal end of heaven, or hell
            - either way (as inoculator or stiffener)
                - the|all four elements would function together as follows:

                i) each authority (1) is exposed to public critique (a)
                ii) public criticism is directed at both the validity
                    - of the authority's personal, endmost goal (c)
                    - and the coherence between her F-institutional change and her goal (d)
                iii) people hear this critique and reflect on it [locally]
                        - each in light of his own endmost goal (c)
                        - "am I satisfied that her change coheres with *my* goal?"

                    - people judge the change as harmful
                    - and act in opposition to it (d, a)
                v) the balance of public opinion tilts either to opposition or acceptance
                vi) according to the balance of public opinion
                    - the authority either drops her change (abandons it, reverses it)
                    - or carries on with it (b)

            - this mechanism would tend to block
                - F-institutional changes that are harmful and ill considered
                - while passing those that are beneficial
            - it would stiffen the institution of F∼ against erosion by unnecessary changes that weaken it (1)
                - keeping it approximately|near|roughly as strong as [current] circumstances will allow
                - and better able to withstand sudden shocks (2) without failing (3)

            - already the institution of F∼ emplaces the necessary elements (a, b)
            - they function as attachments for the remaining elements (c, d)
                - which are the stiffening elements proper
            - these stiffening elements could be emplaced by the institution of G

        - this first trial indicates two ways in which [\means] G coheres with the end:
            - first directly
                - as a means in its own right
            - second indirectly
                - as a structural support for the separate means of F∼
                - preventing its collapse
        - compared to its total absence (G′ko)
            - G's presence within the structure has greater fitness
        - therefore the subsequent trials assume (in imagination) the structural presence of [form] G
            - or some G-like formula
        - by "structural presence" I mean institution
        - to help imagine the institution of G
            - I think of the already familiar institution of F∼
            - and its deep, broad anchoring in everyday society
        - [there] one may:

            • be inclined to think ill of F∼
                - but most of the people one meets|encounters will be inclined to think highly of it
            • speak out against F∼
                - but others will generally reply in its defence
            • act with force (or threat of force) contrary to F∼
                - but others will [generally] contrive to counter with equal or greater force (or threat)

        - the same now goes for G
        - for the duration of these trials
            - I beg all four [adjunct] hypotheses and more
            - in order to [look back and] reflect critically on G and F
            - and my formulation of them
        - I imagine the composite structure (G, F) sunk into a society
            - that has no other purpose than to receive and hold it
        - I view society instrumentally as an extension of the structural means
            - the mere *frame* of a vehicle
            - [that's] designed [just] to reach the end
        - or better yet
            - the passive *footings* of a tremendous bridge [or tower]
        - under trial are the main members that rise on those footings
            - and transmit [to it] the full load

             <!-- Above all, the peculiarity of the intellectual strata in this matter has been in the past
                  of the greatest importance for religion. At the present time, it matters little
                  in the development of a religion whether or not modern intellectuals feel the need
                  of enjoying a 'religious' state as an 'experience,' in addition to all sorts
                  of other sensations, in order to decorate their internal and stylish furnishings
                  with paraphernalia guaranteed to be genuine and old.  A religious revival has never sprung
                  from such a source.  In the past, it was the work of the intellectuals to sublimate
                  the possession of sacred values into a belief in 'redemption.'  The conception of the idea
                  of redemption, as such, is very old, if one understands by it a liberation from distress,
                  hunger, drought, sickness, and ultimately from suffering and death.  Yet redemption attained
                  a specific significance only where it expressed a systematic and rationalized
                  'image of the world' and represented a stand in the face of the world.  For the meaning
                  as well as the intended and actual psychological quality of redemption has depended upon
                  such a world image and such a stand. -->
                ' Not ideas, but material and ideal interests, directly govern men's conduct.
                  Yet very frequently the 'world images' created by 'ideas' have, like switchmen,
                  determined the tracks along which action has been pushed by the dynamic of interest.
             <!-- 'From what' and 'for what' one wished to be redeemed and, let us not forget,
                  'could be' redeemed, depended upon one's image of the world. -->

                - those "world images" are mythic [\images]
                - as [involuntary] "switchmen" they do not depend directly on personal action
            - the [mythic] images themselves act (not the person)
            - they act most directly by relating a person's emotion (not action) to a goal that lies
              down a particular "track"
            - aesthetic suspension of disbelief and judgement then makes that goal a goal of the person
                - if only temporarily
            - on pain of contradicting F
                - such direct and decisive influence could only ever *come* from the likes of switchmen

            See also his later <i>Toward perpetual peace</i>, where he poses the question
