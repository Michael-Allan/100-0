        - along with these forms
            - I advance four hypotheses and one thesis
        - to help introduce these
            - I abbreviate the forms as:

    <pre id='principle-a'>
        - from these
            - I define two pairs of moral-judicial principles
        - the first [pair of principles] are <span id='imperative-a'>imperatives</span> (commands or urgings):

            = read from flashed URL
                ( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
        - these are not specifically human rights
            - but rather the rights (moral entitlements) of all things:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gr-a'><dfn>G<sub>r</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>To relate P to EndGoal</dd>

        <dd>To promote MaxFree</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre id='right-wrong'>
        - these four principles work together as follows
        - whatever obeys imperatives Gi *and* Fi, one judges to be right
        - whatever opposes a right Gr *or* Fr
            - [that is by] hindering or otherwise reducing the effectiveness of its exercise
            - one judges to be wrong
            = note
                - this implies an identity among three things:
                    - a moral form (viz. the fact or appearance of it)
                    - obeying a moral imperative
                    - and exercising a right
                - in the moral algebra:
                      X ≡ obeying(X<sub>i</sub>) ≡ exercising(X<sub>r</sub>)
                    - where X is G or F
                - the three are identical
        - right (in the moral sense, viz. what ought to be)
            - consists in obedience to both imperatives together
            - while wrong consists in opposing the correlative right of either, or both
        - whatever neither obeys nor opposes, one judges to be neither right nor wrong

        - my|the first hypothesis is:

        - the forms that are basic to morality are also useful guides
            - for the design of structures that are basic to society
        - there is general utility in viewing them not only as moral forms
            - but also as the structural means to the moral end
            ( squeezing 'means' in *here* only to give referent to its mention just below

        - preliminary to any test of these hypotheses
            - I maintain one thesis
            - that the basic forms/means G and F are well derived from their postulates
        - the next three sections introduce this thesis and support it with arguments
            - that extend from the postulates to the moral end, matter, form, and means
        - a <a href='#Conclusion'>concluding section</a> returns briefly to reflect on the four hypotheses
            - and to suggest a way of testing them

                                      particles governed by quantum laws can exhibit connections — they
                                      can “communicate” or display correlations — even when the
                                      particles are separated in spacetime at positions that cannot be
                                      traversed by light. Since special and general relativity are
                                      usually taken to prohibit signals from traveling faster than
                                      light, it seems that their accounts of spacetime structure will
                                      have to be modified to accommodate these startling quantum
                                      phenomena. However, there remains much disagreement about what
                                      exactly relativity prohibits from traveling faster than light:
                                      matter and energy seem clearly to be, but what about causal
                                      processes or information? Like many discoveries that have come out
                                      of quantum mechanics over the last century, these issues can be
                                      complex and difficult to fathom, and experts disagree about the
                                      best way of understanding them.

        - [indeed] such a relation is evident in [the person of] Kant himself
        - moral theorist|philosopher and Pietist Christian in a Christian society
            - he not only believed in the immortality of his soul
            - but advanced in theory that a supposition of personal immortality
              is an essential condition of morality
            = note
                - "Complete adequacy of the will to the moral law"
                  demands endless progress "possible only on the presupposition
                  of an existence and personality — of the same rational being — continuing
                  ad infinitum (which is called the immortality of the soul)."

              / - for my part
              /     - I take "soul" to mean one's contribution to the endless continuity of rational being (M)
              /     - in that sense, I think Kant is only partly correct
              /         - a belief that one's soul is *potentially* immortal
              /         - is likely to help morality
              / - but it would be wrong today (contra Fr) to demand such a belief of others
              / - rather the only consensus I would demand
              /     - is a respect for rights Gr and Fr
              // churlish to interject it here, but worth recording somehow
        - yet for all his Pietist upbringing
            - he had this cool, reserved, disarming (I would now say formal)
              way of looking into heartfelt matters
            - that I found so instructive
        - more than this
            - when he turned his critical eye [on]to the rationalism
              that [everywhere] threatened to undermine Christian society
                = critique
                    - Kant was equally concerned about "dogmatic" (and totalizing?) claims
                      of faith against reason, as vice versa.

            - he again saw a form [that is] indispensible to morality

            - eraser in hand

            - and am left with "fear... unreason"
        - but fear of unreason
            - like the value of reason on which it depends (R)
            - is a weighty, substantial thing
        - I rely on Kant's critical eye to pick out its form
        ' Reason must view herself as the authoress of her principles,
          independently of alien influences, and must consequently, as practical reason,
          or as the will of a rational being, by herself be viewed as free...
          From this stem all judgements about actions such that they *ought* to have been *done*
          even if they *were not done*.
            ( Groundwork 4:448, 55
            ( a kind of *pragmatic argument* for freedom http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatic-belief-god/
        - this supposition of freedom
            - which Kant here calls a 'view'
            - I call a 'form'
        - hereafter
            - when I speak of just 'freedom' unqualified
            - what I mean precisely is the form (supposition, assumption or view) of freedom
            ( get this out the way ASAP

        - does M really have this form?
        - Kant speaks of reason applied "as practical reason, or as the will of a rational being"
            = note
                - its other application he labels 'theoretical' or 'speculative' reason [4:391]
                - viz. reasoning about *what is*, as opposed to *what to do*
        - in reasoning about *what to do*
            - in other words
            - one assumes the freedom to make up one's own mind on the matter
            - and to act accordingly
        - this assumption is present in M
        - there reasoning has turned to a practical matter
            - to the matter of preserving itself in the face of a present danger
            - because it sees a potential way of doing so
        - M has practical reason's form
            - and therefore assumes the form of freedom

        - but M is based on a *supreme* valuation of reason (R)
            - and looks to a physical (temporal, and indeed spatial) maximization of reason
            - as rational being
        - therefore I infer not only the form of practical reason (freedom)
            - but its maximization

            - Britain, Victorian I think
            - common enough that engineers kept score of each others' fallen bridges
            - in engineering library

        - one way to gain a deeper understanding of things
            - is to (break them | see them [break, or lying] broken) | see them break)
        = note
            - woe to the toys of a child with a rock
            - woe to the innocent pets
        - to do that
            - I now extend the scope of formal fitness (validity of form)
            - beyond the hylomorphic logic of the previous section
            - to include artificial causation
        - here I view the forms
            - not as abstractions after the fact of the moral matter
            - but as the means to [realize] the moral end (table above)
                = note
                    - Kant also has matter as 'end' 4:436, though didn't see where he speaks of 'means'
                    ( unsure how I got idea for this type of relation, which is reason for this note
        - this introduces a criterion of means-end coherence
            - I expect the combined forms (G, F)
                - to maximize the probability of securing the endless continuity of rational being (M)
        - by analogy with structural engineering
            - I call this newly introduced criterion a 'load' or 'stress'
            - on the composite 'structure' of the forms
        - I investigate what happens to that load (to means-end coherence)
            - when I forcefully deform, reform or otherwise 'break' the structure supporting it

        - I'll explain more about the trial method as the trials proceed
        - meantime
            - load applied

        </dl>
    <pre>
        - G′ko [completely] knocks G (out of | from) the structure
        - F alone remains
        ( direct argument first
            - G′ko means
                - no structural support for goal orientation
                - no expectation that people are trying to achieve anything at all
                    - as per status quo, today
                    - out of sight, out of mind
            - that seems to decrease the likelihood|probability of the deliberate attainment of ends
                - not only [the attainment of] ends in general
                - but *en passant* the specific end of M
            - ∴ G′ko reduces means-end coherence
            - the structure is sagging here
                - not [confidently] carrying the full load

        ( indirect argument now
            - I look at the sagging structure with alarm
            - I inspect it more closely
            - it's not unusual for me to be alarmed
                - about [the vulnerability of] F∼ [on the slightest provocation]
            - I'm quick to suspect that it's in [imminent] danger of collapse
            - balanced against this suspicion
                - I can usually weigh several centuries of successful institution
                - that show no evidence of instability
                - (or none that I'm aware of)
                - and that'll be enough to temper my alarm
            - but now there's a difference
            - signs of strain in the structure
            - direct my thoughts back to the load it bears
            - I think [a time span of] a few centuries is irrelevant to a load of this nature
            - it's not the time *since* F∼'s institution that matters [here]
                - but the [prior] time to achieve that institution [in the first place]
                - and above all the time [hence] to achieve the [sought for] end

            - differences that come with lengthened prospect:
                - underlines[?] importance of F∼
                    - hard won institution of F∼ [we have] may be the last (we ever see | there ever is)
                    - to lose it might leave us no means whatsoever to reach the [sought for] end
                - lifts the likelihood of unlikely events
                - dangers that formally lay below|beyond|outside
                    - the horizon|bounds [of prudence|probability]
                    - now rise|appear as structural design constraints
            - lengthening the prospect elevates my usual worry and enlarges its danger
            - I sketch that danger in outline:

                1) a weakening of the institution of F∼ owing to a series of changes
                    - each the deliberate act of a legitimate authority in response to the pressure of events
                2) a shock to the now weakened institution
                    - whether internal or external in origin
                    - that imposes extreme, unforseen stress

            - enshrined alone
                - as freedom for its own sake
                - F∼ may be [dangerously] unstable in the long term|prospect
            - one way to counter that instability
                - is to stiffen the institution of F∼ against the gradual weakening of (1)
                - so that it's better prepared to handle the sudden stress of (2)
            - a key problem for the design of the stiffener
                - is that the weakening is the consequence of step-wise changes
                    - each in itself warranted by a situation [that is] unknown to the designer
                - it would be counterproductive to block any change where the warrant is valid
                    - viz. where the change would be beneficial in the end, all things considered
            - accordingly the best design I can think of would depend on these four structural elements:

                a) freedom of speech
                b) a politics accountable to the public (e.g. a broad electorate)
                c) a general habit of possessing an endmost goal
                d) a general habit of relating one's action to one's endmost goal

            - if you sometimes feel that grandeurized|grand visions of utopian ends
                - pose the greatest danger to freedom
                    = tie this explicitly to Berlin
                        ( either his essay on two freedoms, or the decline of utopian thinking in the West
                - then think of (c, d) as the structural elements of a general inoculation
                    - against the infectious allure of such visions
                  / = note
                  /     - think how much less a workers' paradise on earth
                  /         - or a thousand-year Reich
                  /         - could take hold in a medieval imagination
                  /         - already habituated to contemplating the eternal end of heaven, or hell
            - either way (as inoculator or stiffener)
                - the|all four elements would function together as follows:

                i) each authority (1) is exposed to public critique (a)
                ii) public criticism is directed at both the validity
                    - of the authority's personal, endmost goal (c)
                    - and the means-end coherence between her F-institutional change and her goal (d)
                    ( note HH
                iii) people hear this critique and reflect on it
                        - each in light of his own endmost goal (c)
                        - and the means-end coherence of the authority's change localized to that goal
                        - "am I satisfied that her change fits *my* goal?"
                iv) where the localization dissatisfies them
                    - people judge the change as harmful
                    - and act in opposition to it (d, a)
                v) the balance of public opinion tilts either to opposition or acceptance
                vi) according to the balance of public opinion
                    - the authority either drops her change (abandons it, reverses it)
                    - or carries on with it (b)

            - this mechanism would tend to block
                - F-institutional changes that are harmful and ill considered
                - while passing those that are beneficial
            - it would stiffen the institution of F∼ against unnecessary changes that weaken it (1)
                - keeping it approximately|near|roughly as strong as [current] circumstances will allow
                - and better able to withstand sudden shocks (2)

            - already the institution of F∼ emplaces the necessary elements (a, b)
            - they function as attachments for the remaining elements (c, d)
                - which are the stiffening elements proper
            - these stiffening elements could be emplaced by the institution of G

        - this first trial indicates two ways in which G is means-end coherent:
            - first directly
                - as a means in its own right
            - second indirectly
                - as a structural support for the separate means of F∼
        - compared to its total absence (G′ko)
            - G's presence within the structure has greater fitness
        - therefore the subsequent trials assume (in imagination) the structural presence of [form] G
            - or some G-like formulation
        - by "structural presence" I mean institution
        - to help imagine the institution of G
            - I think of the already familiar institution of F∼
            - and its deep, broad anchoring in everyday society
        - [there] one may:

            • be inclined to think ill of F∼
                - but most of the people one meets|encounters will be inclined to think highly of it
            • speak out against F∼
                - but others will generally reply in its defence
            • act with force (or threat of force) contrary to F∼
                - but others will [generally] contrive to counter with equal or greater force (or threat)

        - the same now goes for G
        - for the duration of these trials
            - I beg all four hypotheses and more
            - in order to [look back and] reflect critically on the forms
            - and their [detailed] formulation
        - I imagine the composite structure (G, F) sunk into a society
            - that has no other purpose than to receive and hold it
        - I view society instrumentally as an extension of the structural means
            - the mere *frame* of a vehicle
            - [that's] designed [just] to reach the end
        - or better yet
            - the passive *footings* of a tremendous bridge [or tower]
        - under trial are the main members that rise on those footings
            - and transmit [to it] the full load
            - as they span the great distance from here to there

            - I built structures based on intuited moral matter [M∼]
                - unexplained, incomplete
            - then I felt the need|want of theory
            - theory seems to explain practice
                - and told me how to complete it (add G)

            - yet even now
                - I feel the greatest risk is already a practical one
            - for one
                - maybe I need do no more theory at all
                - maybe I fail and then no need
                - or maybe experts will do what's needed
            - for another
                - I haven't the nous to evaluate the theory on its own terms
                    - to know whether its worth developing further
