    <pre>
        - their logical derivation from [the] postulates is my thesis
        - my argument for that derivation occupies the main sections of the paper [below]
        - I use the remainder of this [preliminary] section to introduce working definitions
          and four adjunct hypotheses
        - together they frame the space of a [potential] normative ethics into which [I think] the thesis
          might develop
        - to help introduce them
            - I abbreviate the forms as:

        </dl>
    <pre id='inflection-a'>
        - next I introduce three pairs of formal inflections
        - each pair is a re-expression of the moral forms in a context of everyday, conventional ethics
        - the first are <span id='imperative-a'>imperatives</span> (commands or urgings)
            - which puts them in the familiar context of duty
            - or responsibility:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gi-a'><dfn>G<sub>i</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate P to EndGoal</dd>
        <dt id='Fi-a'><dfn>F<sub>i</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote MaxFree</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - the next pair are <span id='right-a'>rights</span>
        - these are not specifically human rights
            - but rather the rights (moral entitlements) of all things:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gr-a'><dfn>G<sub>r</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>To relate P to EndGoal</dd>
        <dt id='Fr-a'><dfn>F<sub>r</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>To promote MaxFree</dd>
        <!-- form of both in Hohfeldian typology of rights: "privilege", aka "liberty" -->
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - the final pair of inflections are <span id='virtue-a'>virtues</span>
            - which have the same definition as the uninflected forms:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gv-a'><dfn>G<sub>v</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relating P to EndGoal</dd>
        <dt id='Fv-a'><dfn>F<sub>v</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promoting MaxFree</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre id='judicial-property-a'>
        - underlying the inflections and relating them [back] to the forms
          is|there's an equivalence of four judicial properties
        - in the moral algebra:

              FORM = obeying(FORM<sub>i</sub>) = exercising(FORM<sub>r</sub>) = manifesting(FORM<sub>v</sub>)
                - where FORM is G or F

        - each of the|these four properties is equivalent
            - to have *one* [property]
                - either a form
                - obeying an imperative
                - exercising a right
                - or manifesting a virtue
            - is to have *all* [four] [of them]
        </pre>
    <pre id='judicial-rule-a'>
        - these properties [and their equivalence[s]] figure in two judicial rules
            - which together define right and wrong
            - and serve to guide moral judgement
        - the two rules are:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='RR-a'><dfn>RR</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Right consists in having the forms G and F, or having the equivalent judicial properties
            </dd>
        <dt id='RW-a'><dfn>RW</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Wrong consists in countering a form G or F, or an equivalent judicial property,
            by reducing its effective quality or quantity
            </dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - in application these rules assign each judgement to one of four cases:
            - right, wrong, neither or both
        - (1)
            - whatever has forms G *and* F
                - one judges to be right
            - equivalently
                - whatever obeys imperatives Gi and Fi
                - or manifests virtues Gv and Fv
                    - and so on
                    - for any eqivalent combination
                - one judges to be right
        - (2)
            - whatever counters a form G *or* F
                - one judges to be wrong
            - equivalently
                - whatever counters the exercise of a right Gr or Fr
                - (or the obeying of an imperative Gi or Fi, and so on)
                - by hindering or otherwise reducing its effectiveness
                - one judges to be wrong
        - moral right (1) consists in possessing two complementary properties together
            - both a G-form and an F-form [property]
            - while wrong (2) consists in countering any [property] of either form

        - (3)
            - whatever *neither* possesses both *nor* counters any
                - one judges to be neither right nor wrong
            = here is space for other norms
                - perhaps including:
                    - moral norms further to those defined here
                    - law and legal norms
                    - customary|traditional norms carried (on the current of | along by) everyday practices

        - (4)
            - whatever *both* possesses two complementary properties by rule RR
              *and* counters one {property} by rule RW
                - one judges to be both right and wrong
            - such a thing is morally conflicted
            - to learn more
                - there are two [obvious] steps
            - first
                - decompose the thing into parts and judge each part separately
            - continue decomposing \in depth\ till no part remains conflicted
                - each being either right, wrong or neither
            - then the cause of the moral conflict is revealed in the composing of specific parts
                - each clearly right or wrong in itself
                - but together conflicted

            = add second step
                - refering to application of other norms above for guidance on the composing of the parts
                    - and the conflicted composition that results

        - my|the first [adjunct] hypothesis is:

    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>H1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>

    <pre>
        - the rules are adequate for my personal use
        - they're feasible to apply and unproblematic in application
        - any ruled judgement that initially surprises me [nevertheless] makes sense on subsequent reflection
        - no judgement brings me into conflict with society

    <pre>
        - just as they're adequate for me

        - the demand for goal orientation is deep and extensive
        - it will eagerly vacuum up supply
        - the supply needn't be pressured nor pushed
            - only made available
        - any competent tools or affordances [of goal orientation] will be readily taken up
        </pre>

    <pre>
        - the forms that are basic to morals|morality are also useful guides
          for the design of structures that are basic to society
        - here they have general utility in reforming society as the means to the moral end

        - preliminary to any test of these hypotheses
            - I maintain one thesis
            - that the basic forms/means G and F are well derived from their postulates
        - the next three sections introduce this thesis and support it with arguments
          that extend from the postulates through [the] end, matter, form, and means
        - a <a href='#Conclusion'>concluding section</a> returns briefly to the hypotheses
          with a suggestion on how to begin testing them

        - what shape shall I take?

        = about this question
            - I never had to ask [myself] this question before
            - society shaped me - in the sense that I mean here
            - why I don't know
                - for I never asked either what lay behind its shaping
                - what material cause
            - now a cause comes to me unbidden and I see that it's something new
            - it behoves me to ask
                - what shape shall I *now* take?

        = first clue
            ( 1 of 2 that I trust and will rely on
            - the shape I already have

            - the shape I see in M
            - call it the *medieval form*
                - because it looks that way
                ( though its mode of redemption (q.v.) differs
            - symbol G∼
        = framing a solution
            - my clues are of two ages
            - this suggests that my solution (the shape I seek) may pertain to a third age
                - which in turn suggests a sequence of historical transformations

                    G∼  --→  F∼  --→  ?

        = formal constraints
            - I could hardly abandon F∼
            - I wish not to abandon G∼
                - it seems a reliable clue, revealed in both history and M
            ∴ I seek a shape that maintains two forms at once
                - symbolized as G + F

                    G∼  --→  F∼  --→  G + F

            - constraints:

                a) G is like G∼
                b) F is like F∼
                c) each is abstracted from the moral matter M
                d) each is clearly formulated
                e) both are mutually compatible

        - already F∼ is roughly formulated above
        - next I want G∼
        - it's exposed on the surface of M
            - (which allows | allowing) me to isolate it by simple erasure
        - erasing all but the iconically medieval parts {of M} yields:
          "In continual fear... I... reaffirm my devotion to... endless continuity"
        - abstraction eliminates the material particulars to reveal the form:

            - early bridge failures
                - Victorian Britain I think
            - common enough (I read) that engineers kept score (?) of each others' fallen bridges
                - read ∼2001 in book from engineering library
            = source

        - one way to gain a deeper understanding of things
            - is to (break them | see them [break, or lying] broken) | see them break)
        - to do that
            - I now extend the scope of formal fitness (validity of form)
            - beyond the hylomorphic analysis of the previous section
            - to include artificial causation
        - here I view the forms
            - not as abstractions after the fact of the moral matter
            - but as the means to [realize] the moral end (table above)
                = note
                    - Kant also has matter as 'end' 4:436, though didn't see where he speaks of 'means'
                    ( unsure how I got idea for this type of relation, which is reason for this note
        - this introduces a criterion of means-end coherence
            - I expect the combined forms (G, F)
                - to maximize the probability of securing the endless continuity of rational being (M)
        - by analogy with structural engineering
            - I call this newly introduced criterion a 'load' or 'stress'
            - on the composite 'structure' of the forms
        - I investigate what happens to that load (the end)
            - when I forcefully deform, reform or otherwise 'break' the structure that supports it (the means)

        - I'll explain more about the trial method as the trials proceed

    <pre>
        - G′ko [completely] knocks G (out of | from) the structure
        - F alone remains
        [ direct argument
            - G′ko means
                - no structural support for goal orientation
                - no expectation that people are trying to achieve anything at all
                    - as per status quo, today
                    - out of sight, out of mind
            - that seems to decrease the likelihood|probability of the deliberate attainment of ends
                - not only [the attainment of] ends in general
                - but *en passant* the specific end of M
            - ∴ G′ko reduces means-end coherence
            - the structure is sagging here
                - not [confidently] carrying the full load

        [ indirect argument
            - I look at the sagging structure with alarm
            - I inspect it more closely
            - it's not unusual for me to be alarmed
                - about [the vulnerability of] F∼ [on the slightest provocation]
            - I'm quick to suspect that it's in [imminent] danger of collapse
            - balanced against this suspicion
                - I can usually weigh several centuries of successful institution
                - that show no evidence of instability
                - (or none that I'm aware of)
                - and that'll be enough to temper my alarm
            - but now there's a difference
            - signs of strain in the structure
            - direct my thoughts back to the load it bears
            - I think [a time span of] a few centuries is irrelevant to a load of this nature
            - it's not the time *since* F∼'s institution that matters [here]
                - but the [prior] time to achieve that institution [in the first place]
                - and, above all, the time [hence] to achieve the material end

            - differences that come with lengthened prospect:
                - underlines[?] importance of F∼
                    - hard won institution of F∼ [we have] may be the last (we ever see | there ever is)
                    - to lose it might leave us no means whatsoever to reach the material end
                - lifts the likelihood of unlikely events
                - dangers that formally lay below|beyond|outside
                    - the horizon|bounds [of prudence|probability]
                    - now rise|appear as structural design constraints
            - lengthening the prospect elevates my usual worry and enlarges its danger
            - I sketch that danger in outline:

                1) a weakening of the institution of F∼ owing to a series of changes
                    - each the deliberate act of a legitimate authority in response to the pressure of events
                2) a shock to the now weakened institution
                    - whether internal or external in origin
                    - that imposes great|extreme, unforseen stress

            - enshrined alone
                - as freedom for its own sake
                - F∼ may be [dangerously] unstable in the long term|prospect
            - one way to counter that instability
                - is to stiffen the institution of F∼ against the gradual weakening of (1)
                - so that it's better prepared to handle the sudden stress of (2)
            - a key problem for the design of the stiffener
                - is that the weakening is the consequence of step-wise changes
                    - each in itself warranted by a situation [that is] unknown to the designer
                - it would be counterproductive to block any change where the warrant is valid
                    - viz. where the change would be beneficial in the end, all things considered
            - accordingly the best design I can think of would depend on these four structural elements:

                a) freedom of speech
                b) a politics accountable to the public (e.g. a broad electorate)
                c) a general habit of possessing an endmost goal
                d) a general habit of relating one's action to one's endmost goal

            - if you sometimes feel that grandeurized|grand visions of utopian ends
                - pose the greatest danger to freedom
                    = tie this explicitly to Berlin
                        ( either his essay on two freedoms, or the decline of utopian thinking in the West
                - then think of (c, d) as the structural elements of a general inoculation
                    - against the infectious allure of such visions
                  / = note
                  /     - think how much less a workers' paradise on earth
                  /         - or a thousand-year Reich
                  /         - could take hold in a medieval imagination
                  /         - already habituated to contemplating the eternal end of heaven, or hell
            - either way (as inoculator or stiffener)
                - the|all four elements would function together as follows:

                i) each authority (1) is exposed to public critique (a)
                ii) public criticism is directed at both the validity
                    - of the authority's personal, endmost goal (c)
                    - and the coherence between her F-institutional change and her goal (d)
                iii) people hear this critique and reflect on it [locally]
                        - each in light of his own endmost goal (c)
                        - "am I satisfied that her change coheres with *my* goal?"
                iv) where the localization dissatisfies them
                    - people judge the change as harmful
                    - and act in opposition to it (d, a)
                v) the balance of public opinion tilts either to opposition or acceptance
                vi) according to the balance of public opinion
                    - the authority either drops her change (abandons it, reverses it)
                    - or carries on with it (b)

            - this mechanism would tend to block
                - F-institutional changes that are harmful and ill considered
                - while passing those that are beneficial
            - it would stiffen the institution of F∼ against erosion by unnecessary changes that weaken it (1)
                - keeping it approximately|near|roughly as strong as [current] circumstances will allow
                - and better able to withstand sudden shocks (2)

            - already the institution of F∼ emplaces the necessary elements (a, b)
            - they function as attachments for the remaining elements (c, d)
                - which are the stiffening elements proper
            - these stiffening elements could be emplaced by the institution of G

        - this first trial indicates two ways in which {means} G coheres with the end:
            - first directly
                - as a means in its own right
            - second indirectly
                - as a structural support for the separate means of F∼
        - compared to its total absence (G′ko)
            - G's presence within the structure has greater fitness
        - therefore the subsequent trials assume (in imagination) the structural presence of [form] G
            - or some G-like formulation
        - by "structural presence" I mean institution
        - to help imagine the institution of G
            - I think of the already familiar institution of F∼
            - and its deep, broad anchoring in everyday society
        - [there] one may:

            • be inclined to think ill of F∼
                - but most of the people one meets|encounters will be inclined to think highly of it
            • speak out against F∼
                - but others will generally reply in its defence
            • act with force (or threat of force) contrary to F∼
                - but others will [generally] contrive to counter with equal or greater force (or threat)

        - the same now goes for G
        - for the duration of these trials
            - I beg all four [adjunct] hypotheses and more
            - in order to [look back and] reflect critically on the forms
            - and their [detailed] formulation
        - I imagine the composite structure (G, F) sunk into a society
            - that has no other purpose than to receive and hold it
        - I view society instrumentally as an extension of the structural means
            - the mere *frame* of a vehicle
            - [that's] designed [just] to reach the end
        - or better yet
            - the passive *footings* of a tremendous bridge [or tower]
        - under trial are the main members that rise on those footings
            - and transmit [to it] the full load
            - as they span the great distance from here to there

                ' Not ideas, but material and ideal interests directly govern men's conduct.

            An F instance <em>as such</em> is also a G instance on two conditions: i) the promoter is a person,

            of course, make the general forms G and F themselves equivalent.
