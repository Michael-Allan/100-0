        The principles are imperative in form:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate personal action to an ultimate end</dd>
        <dt><dfn>M2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        For my part, I take these principles to be sufficient for moral judgement.
        Whatever obeys them, I judge to be right; whatever counters them, wrong.
        Right (viz. what ought to be) consists in obedience to both principles together,
        while wrong consists in countering either, or both.
        That which neither obeys nor counters, I judge to be neither right nor wrong.
        </p>
    <p>
        But I will not advance a general claim of completeness here.<sup class='ref'><a href='#SC' id='SC-a'>SC</a></sup>
        Here I intend only to convince you that M1 and M2 are well fitted to their postulates
        and useful in designing real structures.

        The postulates are:

         Even the most urgent of news cannot travel very quickly through the stars.
         But sometimes a limitation is a good thing, especially in human affairs.
         The philosopher and historian of ideas, Isaiah Berlin, who was much concerned
         with political ethics and the dangers of violence in pursuing collective ends,
         once recommended that the best we might hope for is some kind of limiting arrangement
         that served to protect “differing groups of human beings — at the very least to prevent them
         from attempting to exterminate each other, and, so far as possible, to prevent them
         from hurting each other”.<sup class='ref'><a href='#Ber78' id='Ber78p50'>Ber78</a></sup>

        That is not good enough.  There are others to consider.
        The engineer as such does not look across the gorge and think only of getting to the far side.
        He thinks of other travellers getting there, too.  He thinks of a structure such as a bridge.
        And not just one bridge.  Any crossing that is difficult might need a bridge of its own.
        This gets him thinking of other engineers and the problem of designing bridges in general.
        In this manner, by generalizing away the object and erasing the particular,
        the engineer cuts away and hollows out the material at hand to yield the abstract, formal
        principles on which the design of any number of concrete structures may be shaped.<sup class='ref'><a href='#MF' id='MF-a'>MF</a></sup>

        I will not try to explain how I arrived at these forms.  They seem at once obvious and impenetrable.
        But given these forms and having reflected on them,
        I will try to explain why I think they are good ones.

            Being an engineer,
            I cannot see how to apply Kant’s moral principle “cleansed of everything empirical”
            except by reformulating it on empirical grounds (P1, P2).
            Nor can I see how to argue from those grounds purely by logic,
            so that here I introduce further elements from the world of experience.
            Yet I respect Kant’s opinion and wish to avoid “peddling the empirical mixed with the rational”.
            Therefore I restrict the scope of my claims for the result (M1, M2),
            which I present not as an absolute “moral law” for all possible universes,
            but as a fallible “practical rule” for this one.<sup class='ref'><a href='#Kan4' id='Kan4q388-9'>Kan4</a></sup>

            Note that here M1 correlates to ‘will’ and M2 the ‘idea of freedom’.
