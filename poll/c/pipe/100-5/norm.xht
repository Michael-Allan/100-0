<section>
    <p>
        Morality takes an imperative form in two commanding principles:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate personal action to an ultimate end</dd>
        <dt><dfn>M2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum of personal freedom compatible with equal freedoms for all</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        Freedom means the ability to do as one wishes.  To this ability,
        principle M2 adds the properties of uniformity (‘equal’) and extension (‘for all’)
        and demands a simultaneous maximum of all three.
        </p>
    <p>
        All that is right obeys these principles.  All that is wrong counters them.
        Right (or what ought to be) consists in obedience to both principles together,
        while wrong consists in countering either, or both.
        </p>
    <p>
        The premises are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Morality can think rationally</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        Morality is more than a static set of principles.  It also has a dynamic ability to reason.
        Here imagine morality as an aspect of God, or as an earthly community of thought;
        but what the argument below presumes is just its inherent ability to reason.<sup class='ref'><a href='#PR' id='PR-a'>PR</a></sup>
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Morality values reason above all</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        Not only can morality reason, but it can also value.  And what it values most is reason.
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P3</dfn></dt>
        <dd>All communications are limited to light speed</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
         Even the most urgent of news cannot travel very quickly through the stars.
         But sometimes a limitation is a good thing, especially in human affairs.
         The philosopher and historian of ideas, Isaiah Berlin, who was much concerned
         with political ethics and the dangers of violence in pursuing collective ends,
         once recommended that the best we might hope for is some kind of limiting arrangement
         that served to protect “differing groups of human beings — at the very least to prevent them
         from attempting to exterminate each other, and, so far as possible, to prevent them
         from hurting each other”.<sup class='ref'><a href='#Ber78' id='Ber78p50'>Ber78</a></sup>
        </p>
    <p>
        …
        A grand-scale version of this safeguard is already offered in the limit of light speed.
        …
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M0</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Morality consists in seeking the endless continuity of rational being
            within the space of possibility that opens on the limit of light speed

            This unlikely conjunction of astrophysics and ethics has a parallel
            in Kant’s humble confession|disclosure, later quoted as his epitaph:
            “Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence,
            the more often and more steadily one reflects on them:
            the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.” —
