        - the two forms are:
        </pre>

        <dd>Relating the personal to the endmost goal of the person</dd>
        <dt id='F-a'><dfn>F</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promoting a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - their logical derivation from [the] postulates is my thesis
        - my argument for that derivation occupies the main sections of the paper [below]
        - I use the remainder of this [preliminary] section to introduce working definitions
          and four adjunct hypotheses
        - these frame the space of a potential normative ethics [into which [I think] the thesis might develop]
        - to help define that space
            - I abbreviate the forms as:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>G</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relating P to EndGoal</dd>
        <dt><dfn>F</dfn></dt>

        </dl>
    <pre id='inflection-a'>
        - next I introduce three pairs of formal inflections
        - each pair is a re-expression of the moral forms in a context of everyday, conventional ethics
        - the first are <span id='imperative-a'>imperatives</span> (commands or urgings)
            - which puts them in the familiar context of duty
            - or responsibility:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gi-a'><dfn>G<sub>i</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate P to EndGoal</dd>

        <dd>Promote MaxFree</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - the next pair are <span id='right-a'>rights</span>
        - these are not specifically human rights
            - but rather the rights (moral entitlements) of all things:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gr-a'><dfn>G<sub>r</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>To relate P to EndGoal</dd>
        <dt id='Fr-a'><dfn>F<sub>r</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>To promote MaxFree</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - the final pair of inflections are <span id='virtue-a'>virtues</span>
            - which have the same definition as the uninflected forms:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gv-a'><dfn>G<sub>v</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relating P to EndGoal</dd>
        <dt id='Fv-a'><dfn>F<sub>v</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promoting MaxFree</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre id='property-a'>
        - underlying the inflections and relating them [back] to the forms
          is|there's an equivalence of four judicial properties
        - in the moral algebra:

              FORM = obeying(FORM<sub>i</sub>) = exercising(FORM<sub>r</sub>) = manifesting(FORM<sub>v</sub>)
                - where FORM is G or F

        - each of the|these four properties is equivalent
            - to have *one* [property]
                - either a form
                - obeying an imperative
                - exercising a right
                - or manifesting a virtue
            - is to have *all* [four] [of them]
        </pre>
    <pre id='rule'>
        - these properties [and their equivalence[s]] figure in two judicial rules
            - which together define right and wrong
            - and serve to guide moral judgement
        - the two rules are:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='RR-a'><dfn>RR</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Right consists in having the forms G and F, or having the equivalent judicial properties

        <dt id='RW-a'><dfn>RW</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            Wrong consists in countering a form G or F, or an equivalent judicial property,
            by reducing its effective quality or quantity
            </dd>

    <pre>
        - on one hand
            - whatever has forms G *and* F
            - one judges to be right
        - equivalently
            - whatever obeys imperatives Gi and Fi
            - or manifests virtues Gv and Fv
                - and so on
                - for any eqivalent combination
            - one judges to be right
        - on the other hand
            - whatever counters a form G *or* F
            - one judges to be wrong
        - equivalently
            - whatever counters the exercise of a right Gr or Fr
            - (or the obeying of an imperative Gi or Fi, and so on)
            - by hindering or otherwise reducing its effectiveness
            - one judges to be wrong
        - moral right consists in possessing two complementary properties together
            - both a G-form and an F-form [property]
            - while wrong consists in countering any [property] of either form
        - whatever *neither* possesses both *nor* counters any
            - one judges to be neither right nor wrong
        = add that here is space for other norms
            ( notebook 2016.8?

        - conversely
            - whatever *both* possesses two complementary properties by rule RR
              *and* counters one {property} by rule RW

        - such a thing is morally conflicted
        - to learn more
            - there are two [obvious] steps
        - first
            - decompose the thing into parts and judge each part separately
        - continue decomposing \in depth\ till no part remains conflicted
            - each being either right, wrong or neither
        - then the cause of the moral conflict is revealed in the composing of specific parts
            - each clearly right or wrong in itself
            - but together conflicted

        = add second step
            - refering to application of other norms above for guidance on the composing of the parts
                - and the conflicted composition that results

        - the rules are adequate for my personal use
        - they're feasible to apply and unproblematic in application

        - just as they're adequate for me

        - internal demand for goal orientation is ripe for supply
        - the depth and extent of demand are such that supply needn't be pressured nor pushed
            - only made available
            - and it will flow
        - any competent [tools or] affordances [of G] will be readily taken up

        - the forms that are basic to morals|morality are also useful guides
          for the design of structures that are basic to society
        - here they have general utility in reforming society as the means to the moral end

        - preliminary to any test of these hypotheses
            - I maintain one thesis
            - that the basic forms/means G and F are well derived from their postulates
        - the next three sections introduce this thesis and support it with arguments
          that extend from the postulates through [the] end, matter, form, and means

                                ' It is well-established, both theoretically and empirically, that
                                  particles governed by quantum laws can exhibit connections — they
                                  can "communicate" or display correlations — even when the
                                  particles are separated in spacetime at positions that cannot be
                                  traversed by light. Since special and general relativity are
                                  usually taken to prohibit signals from traveling faster than
                                  light, it seems that their accounts of spacetime structure will
                                  have to be modified to accommodate these startling quantum
                                  phenomena. However, there remains much disagreement about what
                                  exactly relativity prohibits from traveling faster than light:
                                  matter and energy seem clearly to be, but what about causal
                                  processes or information? Like many discoveries that have come out
                                  of quantum mechanics over the last century, these issues can be
                                  complex and difficult to fathom, and experts disagree about the
                                  best way of understanding them.

        - what form does morality take?

        - here's how I learned that it might take and maintain two forms at once
            - and how this led me to search for the first and elder of the two
            - for I came to believe that morality appears in a succession of age-long forms
                - each holding till eventually it gives way to the next
                - and I had begun with the latest|last which still (for me, as well as others)
                  held at that time
        - I saw it everywhere but could only capture it dimly then:

        - I tried to find evidence of this form in the [moral] matter M

            - but didn't see it there
        - this worried|troubled me
            - because my confidence in freedom as a moral principle is unwavering in practice
        - it had become the structural core of my engineering work [in social software]
            - where I pushed it to extremes
        - I was unwilling to give up on it
        - I began to consider that maybe it needn't stand alone
        - maybe it could stand alongside other moral principles
        - soon I was looking in M

            - but for something much older
        - I was looking for something (outside of | that predates) modernity

        - Kant

                - and one in the medieval|pre-modern

        - does M really have this form?
        - Kant speaks of reason applied "as practical reason, or as the will of a rational being"

        - this assumption is present in M
        - there reasoning has turned to a practical matter
            - to the matter of preserving itself in the face of a present danger
            - because it sees a potential way of doing so
        - M has practical reason's form
            - and therefore assumes the form of freedom

        - but M is based on a *supreme* valuation of reason (R)
            - and looks to a physical (temporal, and indeed spatial) maximization of reason
            - as rational being

    <h2><a href='#Fitness'>Imagining trials of structural fitness under load</a></h2>
    <pre>
        = headquote on early bridge failures
            - Britain, Victorian I think
            - common enough that engineers kept score of each others' fallen bridges
            - in engineering library

        - one way to gain a deeper understanding of things
            - is to (break them | see them [break, or lying] broken) | see them break)
        - to do that
            - I now extend the scope of formal fitness (validity of form)
            - beyond the hylomorphic analysis of the previous section
            - to include artificial causation
        - here I view the forms
            - not as abstractions after the fact of the moral matter
            - but as the means to [realize] the moral end (table above)
                = note
                    - Kant also has matter as 'end' 4:436, though didn't see where he speaks of 'means'
                    ( unsure how I got idea for this type of relation, which is reason for this note
        - this introduces a criterion of means-end coherence
            - I expect the combined forms (G, F)
                - to maximize the probability of securing the endless continuity of rational being (M)
        - by analogy with structural engineering
            - I call this newly introduced criterion a 'load' or 'stress'
            - on the composite 'structure' of the forms
        - I investigate what happens to that load (the end)
            - when I forcefully deform, reform or otherwise 'break' the structure that supports it (the means)

        - I'll explain more about the trial method as the trials proceed
        - meantime
            - load applied
            - I start breaking things:
        </pre>
    <dl           id='G-ko'>
        <dt><a href='#G-ko'
                     >G′ko</a></dt>
        <dd>
            <del>Relating the personal to the endmost goal of the person</del>
            </dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - G′ko [completely] knocks G (out of | from) the structure
        - F alone remains
        ( direct argument first
            - G′ko means
                - no structural support for goal orientation
                - no expectation that people are trying to achieve anything at all
                    - as per status quo, today
                    - out of sight, out of mind
            - that seems to decrease the likelihood|probability of the deliberate attainment of ends
                - not only [the attainment of] ends in general
                - but *en passant* the specific end of M
            - ∴ G′ko reduces means-end coherence
            - the structure is sagging here
                - not [confidently] carrying the full load

        ( indirect argument now
            - I look at the sagging structure with alarm
            - I inspect it more closely
            - it's not unusual for me to be alarmed
                - about [the vulnerability of] F∼ [on the slightest provocation]
            - I'm quick to suspect that it's in [imminent] danger of collapse
            - balanced against this suspicion
                - I can usually weigh several centuries of successful institution
                - that show no evidence of instability
                - (or none that I'm aware of)
                - and that'll be enough to temper my alarm
            - but now there's a difference
            - signs of strain in the structure
            - direct my thoughts back to the load it bears
            - I think [a time span of] a few centuries is irrelevant to a load of this nature
            - it's not the time *since* F∼'s institution that matters [here]
                - but the [prior] time to achieve that institution [in the first place]
                - and, above all, the time [hence] to achieve the material end

            - differences that come with lengthened prospect:
                - underlines[?] importance of F∼
                    - hard won institution of F∼ [we have] may be the last (we ever see | there ever is)
                    - to lose it might leave us no means whatsoever to reach the material end
                - lifts the likelihood of unlikely events
                - dangers that formally lay below|beyond|outside
                    - the horizon|bounds [of prudence|probability]
                    - now rise|appear as structural design constraints
            - lengthening the prospect elevates my usual worry and enlarges its danger
            - I sketch that danger in outline:

                1) a weakening of the institution of F∼ owing to a series of changes
                    - each the deliberate act of a legitimate authority in response to the pressure of events
                2) a shock to the now weakened institution
                    - whether internal or external in origin
                    - that imposes extreme, unforseen stress

            - enshrined alone
                - as freedom for its own sake
                - F∼ may be [dangerously] unstable in the long term|prospect
            - one way to counter that instability
                - is to stiffen the institution of F∼ against the gradual weakening of (1)
                - so that it's better prepared to handle the sudden stress of (2)
            - a key problem for the design of the stiffener
                - is that the weakening is the consequence of step-wise changes
                    - each in itself warranted by a situation [that is] unknown to the designer
                - it would be counterproductive to block any change where the warrant is valid
                    - viz. where the change would be beneficial in the end, all things considered
            - accordingly the best design I can think of would depend on these four structural elements:

                a) freedom of speech
                b) a politics accountable to the public (e.g. a broad electorate)
                c) a general habit of possessing an endmost goal
                d) a general habit of relating one's action to one's endmost goal

            - if you sometimes feel that grandeurized|grand visions of utopian ends
                - pose the greatest danger to freedom
                    = tie this explicitly to Berlin
                        ( either his essay on two freedoms, or the decline of utopian thinking in the West
                - then think of (c, d) as the structural elements of a general inoculation
                    - against the infectious allure of such visions
                  / = note
                  /     - think how much less a workers' paradise on earth
                  /         - or a thousand-year Reich
                  /         - could take hold in a medieval imagination
                  /         - already habituated to contemplating the eternal end of heaven, or hell
            - either way (as inoculator or stiffener)
                - the|all four elements would function together as follows:

                i) each authority (1) is exposed to public critique (a)
                ii) public criticism is directed at both the validity
                    - of the authority's personal, endmost goal (c)
                    - and the coherence between her F-institutional change and her goal (d)
                iii) people hear this critique and reflect on it [locally]
                        - each in light of his own endmost goal (c)
                        - "am I satisfied that her change coheres with *my* goal?"
                iv) where the localization dissatisfies them
                    - people judge the change as harmful
                    - and act in opposition to it (d, a)
                v) the balance of public opinion tilts either to opposition or acceptance
                vi) according to the balance of public opinion
                    - the authority either drops her change (abandons it, reverses it)
                    - or carries on with it (b)

            - this mechanism would tend to block
                - F-institutional changes that are harmful and ill considered
                - while passing those that are beneficial
            - it would stiffen the institution of F∼ against unnecessary changes that weaken it (1)
                - keeping it approximately|near|roughly as strong as [current] circumstances will allow
                - and better able to withstand sudden shocks (2)

            - already the institution of F∼ emplaces the necessary elements (a, b)
            - they function as attachments for the remaining elements (c, d)
                - which are the stiffening elements proper
            - these stiffening elements could be emplaced by the institution of G

        - this first trial indicates two ways in which {means} G coheres with the end:
            - first directly
                - as a means in its own right
            - second indirectly
                - as a structural support for the separate means of F∼
        - compared to its total absence (G′ko)
            - G's presence within the structure has greater fitness
        - therefore the subsequent trials assume (in imagination) the structural presence of [form] G
            - or some G-like formulation
        - by "structural presence" I mean institution
        - to help imagine the institution of G
            - I think of the already familiar institution of F∼
            - and its deep, broad anchoring in everyday society
        - [there] one may:

            • be inclined to think ill of F∼
                - but most of the people one meets|encounters will be inclined to think highly of it
            • speak out against F∼
                - but others will generally reply in its defence

            - Latin I think
            - to effect, "I so-and-so built this bridge"

            - not in Roberts' history, must have been engineering library
            ( connects to bridge metaphor in preceding §, and to individual focus in its closing summaries

        [ introduction
            - there are times and places where practice must take priority over theory
                ( alluding to headquote above
                - before theory can return to assume the lead
            - the span of normative ethics I attempt in this paper is necessarily incomplete
            - I describe what I think are the fundaments of a morality
                - emergent in historical time and personal experience
                - then stop
                - [well] short of a complete theory
            - I stop not only because what I describe seems a nascent morality
                - in itself undeveloped and thus incomplete
                - but also because I'm not an expert theoretician to describe it
                    - or prescribe it
                    - or whatever it needs in that way
            - I hope my attempt goes far enough that experts can judge
                - the feasibility of developing that side of it
            - I leave that now
                - and turn to the question of its practical side
                - briefly touching on it|this in conclusion

            - twin purpose here is to lightly, quickly address the practical how-to of:
                1) prima-facie method of validation of theory
                2) immediate feasibility of introducing that method of validation
