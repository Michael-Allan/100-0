<section>
    <p>
        Here I combine my estimation of a large-scale asymmetry in nature,
        together with a personal valuation of reason, to argue for the consequent implication
        of two formal principles of morality.  The two principles are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt id='F1-a'><dfn>F1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate the personal to the endmost goal of the person</dd>
        <dt id='F2-a'><dfn>F2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - I advance three hypotheses concerning these principles, and one thesis
        - my|the first hypothesis (1)
            - is that these principles
                - together with their correlative rights
            - suffice for my personal use
            - they are adequate to rule my moral judgement
        - to explain
            - here are the correlative <a href='#right' id='right-b'>rights</a> that I refer to
        - these are not specifically human rights
            - but rather the rights of all things:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='R1-a'><dfn>R1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>To relate the personal to the endmost goal of the person</dd>
        <dt id='R2-a'><dfn>R2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>To promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - the formal principles and correlative rights work together as follows
        - whatever obeys F1 and F2, I judge to be <a href='#right' id='right-a'>right</a>
        - whatever opposes R1 or R2, I judge to be <a href='#wrong' id='wrong-a'>wrong</a>
        - right (in the moral sense, viz. what ought to be)
            - consists in obedience to both principles together
            - while wrong consists in opposing the correlative right of either, or both
        - whatever neither obeys nor opposes, I judge to be neither right nor wrong
        - my hypothesis here is that these judgements are (for me) sound and reliable

        - I further hypothesize (2) that
            - just as they're adequate for me
            - these same principles and rights are adequate for a majority of people in contemporary society
        - pending any favourable weight|balance of evidence
            - therefore
            - these are only *hypothetical* principles and rights that I speak of
                - usually without qualifying them as such

        - my final hypothesis (3) is that
            - [formal] principles F1 and F2
            - are useful for assessing|evaluating and guiding the design of [basic] societal structures
      / - indeed
      /     - this was my original motivation
      /     - I first formulated these principles as architectural guidelines for social software
      // rather much earlier in aesthetic forms, as immediately related in § below

        - above all
            - I maintain one thesis
            - that F1 and F2 are well derived from their postulates
        - what follows is largely confined to introducing and supporting this claim

                                    ' It is well-established, both theoretically and empirically, that
                                      particles governed by quantum laws can exhibit connections — they
                                      can “communicate” or display correlations — even when the
                                      particles are separated in spacetime at positions that cannot be
                                      traversed by light. Since special and general relativity are
                                      usually taken to prohibit signals from traveling faster than
                                      light, it seems that their accounts of spacetime structure will
                                      have to be modified to accommodate these startling quantum
                                      phenomena. However, there remains much disagreement about what
                                      exactly relativity prohibits from traveling faster than light:
                                      matter and energy seem clearly to be, but what about causal
                                      processes or information? Like many discoveries that have come out
                                      of quantum mechanics over the last century, these issues can be
                                      complex and difficult to fathom, and experts disagree about the
                                      best way of understanding them.

        - what form does morality take?

        - here's how I learned that it might take two forms at once
            - and how this led me to search for the first and elder of the two
        - for I came to believe that morality appears in a succession of age-long forms
            - each holding till eventually it gives way to the next
            - and I had begun with the latest|last
            - which still [(for me, as well as others)] held at that time
        - I saw it everywhere but could only capture it dimly then:

        - I tried to find evidence of this form in the [moral] matter M
            - (itself only dimly formulated at the time)
            - but nowhere could I see it
        - this worried|troubled me
            - because my confidence in freedom as a moral principle is unwavering in practice
        - it had become the structural core of my engineering work [in social software]
            - where I pushed it to extremes
        - I was unwilling to give up on it
        - I began to consider that maybe it needn't stand alone
        - maybe it could stand alongside other moral principles
        - soon I was looking in M
            - not for evidence of [the contempory] F2∼
            - but for something much older
        - I was looking for something (outside of | that predates) modernity

          independently of alien influences, and must consequently, as practical reason,
          or as the will of a rational being, by herself be viewed as free...

                - its other application is 'theoretical' or 'speculative' reason [4:391]

        - in reasoning about *what to do*
            - in other words
            - one assumes the freedom to make up one's own mind on the matter
            - and to act accordingly
        - this assumption is present in M
        - there reasoning has turned to a practical matter
            - to the matter of preserving itself in the face of a present danger
            - because it sees a potential way of doing so
        - therefore M has the form of practical reason
            - which is freedom

        - but M is based on a *supreme* valuation of reason (P2)
            - and looks to a physical (temporal, and indeed spatial) maximization of reason
            - as rational being

        Now I ask you [actually, I must ask myself] to imagine a corresponding practice.
        Therefore suppose that F1 and F2 are realized and introduced to modern society.
        Suppose they become integral to its structure.  Whether by custom, foundational myth,
        institution or device, their effects (imagine) are made pervasive, strong and durable.
        They become a major part of the social fabric.

        Elsewhere I argue for the feasibility of such an introduction.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#AF' id='AF-a'>AF</a>]</sup>
        Here I argue only for its fitness.
        I claim that F1 and F2 together fit the purpose of M exactly.
        Like a perfectly tailored suit of formal wear, nothing remains to be cut
        and no obvious alteration would improve|better the fit.  (And it beats going naked.)
        This cannot prove that it’s the best possible suit [to wear] for the occaision.
        Other combinations of formal principles might fit the purpose
        ([in the sense of] defying any easy alteration) and one might even fit better.

            - footnote to further illustrate mode of argument
                - metaphor of fitness landscape
                - hills (fit) and valleys (unfit)
                - argument tells that form is hill
                    - not that form is only hill (the only fit form) nor tallest hill (the best fit)
            </pre>…
        I have no proof against that possibility.
        But here I have a combination that’s ready to wear and fits exactly,
        and I base my argument on a demonstration of this.

            <span>(matter and form)</span> From the <i>Groundwork</i>:
            <q>All rational cognition is either <i>material</i> and considers some object,
            or <i>formal</i> and occupied merely with the form of the understanding and of reason itself,
            and with the universal rules of thinking as such, regardless of differences among its objects.</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#AA' id='AA-a'>AA</a>, <a href='#Kan85' id='Kan85q4:387'>4:387</a>]</sup>
            <p>
                The specific objects of matter are, in the form, erased by abstraction.
                See also <a href='#Kan85' id='Kan85q4:436'>4:436</a>,
                and later in <i>Toward perpetual peace</i>, where the question is posed
                <q>whether… one should start from the material principle of practical reason,
                the end (as the object of choice), or rather start from its formal principle…
                (whatever the end may be).</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan95' id='Kan95q8:376-8'>8:376-8</a>]</sup>
                </p>
            <p>
                I note that we use similar categories in software engineering.
                There we distinguish <i>formal</i> vs. <i>actual</i> parameters, for example,
                and <i>abstract</i> vs. <i>concrete</i> classes.

                - I think of...
                    = illustrate with Augustine
                    ' … his Latin is often poor.  Yet he was soaked in the classical Roman past.
                      It was from the high ground of his mastery of this tradition that he looked out
                      with the eyes of Christian faith to a cloudy, uncertain and, to other men,
                      frightening future.  He embodied two cultures more completely, perhaps,
                      than any other man of those divided times and perhaps this is why,
                      1,500 years later, he still seems to dominate them.
                        ( J. M. Roberts, 1992.  The History of the World.  Helicon Publishing, Oxford.  p. 236.
                - for me
                    - Kant's grappling with two moral traditions at once
                        - the one receding
                        - the other advancing
                    - gives him that same kind of prominence where he stands
                        - witness to diverging currents of thought
                        - on the high ground of the Enlightenment
                - interestingly he|Kant claims that the inspiration for his "kingdom of ends"
                  came from Augustine's City of God
                    ( http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/GW/KingdomOfEnds.asp
                    - a title that, like its author, straddles two ages
                - Kant's varied formulations of the "moral law" embrace a similar tension [4:436]
