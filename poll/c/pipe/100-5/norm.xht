        The principles are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate personal action to an ultimate end</dd>
        <dt><dfn>M2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        For my part, I take these two principles to be sufficient for moral judgement.
        Whatever obeys them, I judge to be right; whatever counters them, wrong.
        Right (viz. what ought to be) consists in obedience to both principles together,
        while wrong consists in countering either, or both.
        That which neither obeys nor counters, I judge to be neither right nor wrong.
        </p>
    <p>
        But I will not advance a general claim of completeness here.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#SC' id='SC-a'>SC</a>]</sup>
        Here I intend only to convince you that M1 and M2 are well fitted to their postulates
        and useful for structural purposes.  People can build sturdy things with them.
        </p>
    <p>
        The postulates are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>I value reason the most</dd>
        </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>I think that all communications are limited to light speed</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
         Even the most urgent of news cannot travel very quickly through the stars.
         But sometimes a limitation is a good thing, especially in human affairs.
         The philosopher and historian of ideas, Isaiah Berlin, who was much concerned
         with political ethics and the danger of violence in pursuing collective ends,
         once recommended that the best we might hope for is some kind of limiting arrangement
         that served to protect “differing groups of human beings — at the very least to prevent them
         from attempting to exterminate each other, and, so far as possible, to prevent them
         from hurting each other”.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Ber78' id='Ber78p50'>Ber78</a>]</sup>
        </p>
    <p>
        …
        A grand-scale version of this safeguard is already offered in the limit of light speed.
        …
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M0</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            I desire the endless continuity of rational being
            that is made feasible by the limit of light speed
            </dd>

        History gave me M2.  I could almost write it down verbatim:

        I could also get M1 from history if I were to analyze the religious, utopian tradition of my culture.
        In fact I got it by analyzing M0.  In either case, cutting away the particulars
        uncovers an M1-like form.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#MF' id='MF-a'>MF</a>]</sup>
        Yet no inheritance from the past, nor faith, nor hope for the future,
        equips me to argue convincingly for these two principles
        without the material support of M0 and its unshakeable, physical foundation.
        Nor could I reliably interpret the “moral law within me” based on reason
        were it not also written in the “starry heavens above”.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#KE' id='KE-a'>KE</a>]</sup>

            Kant too juxtaposes physics and ethics in the humble declamation, later quoted as his epitaph,
            “Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence,
            the more often and more steadily one reflects on them:
            the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.” —

            These relations of matter and form were suggested by my reading of Kant’s <i>Groundwork</i>.
            “All rational cognition is either <i>material</i> and considers some object,
            or <i>formal</i> and occupied merely with the form of the understanding and of reason itself,
            and with the universal rules of thinking as such, regardless of differences among its objects.” <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan4' id='Kan4q387'>Kan4</a>]</sup>

            I cannot see how to apply Kant’s moral principle “cleansed of everything empirical”
            except by reformulating it on empirical grounds (P1, P2).
            Nor can I see how to argue from those grounds purely by logic,
            so that here I introduce further elements from the world of experience.
            Yet I respect Kant’s opinion and wish to avoid “peddling the empirical mixed with the rational”.
            Therefore I restrict the scope of my claims for the result (M1, M2),
            which I present not as an absolute “moral law” for all possible universes,
            but as a fallible “practical rule” for this one.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan4' id='Kan4q388-9'>Kan4</a>]</sup>

            Kant asserts: “that we must necessarily lend to every rational being that has a will
            also the idea of freedom, under which alone it acts.” <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan4' id='Kan4q448'>Kan4</a>]</sup>
            Note that here M1 correlates to ‘will’ and M2 the ‘idea of freedom’.
