<section>
    <p>
        Here I combine my estimation of an asymmetry emerging at large scales in nature,
        together with a personal valuation of reason, to argue that this combination implies
        a morality [that is] shaped by two inherent forms.  The two forms are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt id='G-a'><dfn>G</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relating the personal to the endmost goal of the person</dd>
        <dt id='F-a'><dfn>F</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promoting a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre id='principle-a'>
        - closely related to these forms
            - I define two pairs of moral principles
        - the first of these are <span id='imperative-a'>imperatives</span>:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gi-a'><dfn>G<sub>i</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate the personal to the endmost goal of the person</dd>
        <dt id='Fi-a'><dfn>F<sub>i</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre>
        - the second are a pair of <span id='right-a'>rights</span>
            = read from flashed URL
                ( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
        - these are not specifically human rights
            - but rather the rights (moral entitlements) of all things:
        </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt id='Gr-a'><dfn>G<sub>r</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>To relate the personal to the endmost goal of the person</dd>
        <dt id='Fr-a'><dfn>F<sub>r</sub></dfn></dt>
        <dd>To promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <pre id='right-wrong'>
        - [moral] imperatives and rights work together as follows
        - whatever obeys imperatives Gi *and* Fi, one judges to be right
        - whatever opposes right Gr *or* Fr
            - that is by hindering or otherwise reducing the effectiveness of its exercise
            - one judges to be wrong
        - right (in the moral sense, viz. what ought to be)
            - consists in obedience to both imperatives together
            - while wrong consists in opposing the correlative right of either, or both
        - whatever neither obeys nor opposes, one judges to be neither right nor wrong

        - based on the foregoing
            - I advance three hypotheses and one thesis
        - my|the first hypothesis (1)
            - is that these two pairs of principles
            - suffice for my personal use
            - they are adequate to rule my own moral judgement
        - in other words
            - the judgements they enable me are (for me) sound and reliable

        - I further hypothesize (2) that
            - just as they're adequate for me
            - these same principles are adequate for a majority of people in contemporary society
      / - pending any balance of evidence in their favour
      /     - therefore
      /     - what I address hereafter are merely *hypothetical* principles
      /         - usually without qualifying them as such
      // perhaps unnecessary as I now speak from outset of "an ethics", "a morality"

        - my final hypothesis (3) is that
            - forms G and F are useful guides for the design of [basic] societal structures

        - preliminary to any test of these hypotheses
            - I maintain one thesis
            - that forms G and F are well derived from their postulates
        - in what follows
            - I confine myself [largely] to introducing this thesis and supporting it with arguments

                                      particles are separated in spacetime at positions that cannot be
                                      traversed by light. Since special and general relativity are
                                      usually taken to prohibit signals from traveling faster than
                                      light, it seems that their accounts of spacetime structure will
                                      have to be modified to accommodate these startling quantum
                                      phenomena. However, there remains much disagreement about what
                                      exactly relativity prohibits from traveling faster than light:
                                      matter and energy seem clearly to be, but what about causal
                                      processes or information? Like many discoveries that have come out
                                      of quantum mechanics over the last century, these issues can be
                                      complex and difficult to fathom, and experts disagree about the
                                      best way of understanding them.

        Now I ask you [actually, I must ask myself] to imagine a corresponding practice.
        Therefore suppose that G and F are realized and introduced to modern society.
        Suppose they become integral to its structure.  Whether by custom, foundational myth,
        institution or device, their effects (imagine) are made pervasive, strong and durable.
        They become a major part of the social fabric.
        </p>
    <p>
        Later I discuss the feasibility of such an introduction.
        Here I argue only for its fitness.
        I claim that G and F together fit the purpose of M exactly.
        Like a perfectly tailored suit of formal wear, nothing remains to be cut
        and no obvious alteration would improve|better the fit.  (And it beats going naked.)
        This cannot prove that it’s the best possible suit [to wear] for the occaision.
        Other combinations of formal principles might fit the purpose
        ([in the sense of] defying any easy alteration) and one might even fit better.
        …<pre>
            - footnote to further illustrate mode of argument
                - metaphor of fitness landscape
                - hills (fit) and valleys (unfit)
                - argument tells that form is hill
                    - not that form is only hill (the only fit form) nor tallest hill (the best fit)
            </pre>…
        I have no proof against that possibility.
        But here I have a combination that’s ready to wear and fits exactly,
        and I base my argument on a demonstration of this.

            <q>All rational cognition is either <i>material</i> and considers some object,
            or <i>formal</i> and occupied merely with the form of the understanding and of reason itself,
            and with the universal rules of thinking as such, regardless of differences among its objects.</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#AA' id='AA-a'>AA</a>, <a href='#Kan85' id='Kan85q4:387'>4:387</a>]</sup>
            <p>
                The specific objects of matter are, in the form, erased by abstraction.
                See also <a href='#Kan85' id='Kan85q4:436'>4:436</a>,
                and later in <i>Toward perpetual peace</i>, where the question is posed
                <q>whether… one should start from the material principle of practical reason,
                the end (as the object of choice), or rather start from its formal principle…
                (whatever the end may be).</q> <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan95' id='Kan95q8:376-8'>8:376-8</a>]</sup>

            <p>
                I note that we use similar categories in software engineering.
                There we distinguish <i>formal</i> vs. <i>actual</i> parameters, for example,
                and <i>abstract</i> vs. <i>concrete</i> classes.

                    = illustrate with Augustine
                    ' … his Latin is often poor.  Yet he was soaked in the classical Roman past.
                      It was from the high ground of his mastery of this tradition that he looked out
                      with the eyes of Christian faith to a cloudy, uncertain and, to other men,
                      frightening future.  He embodied two cultures more completely, perhaps,
                      than any other man of those divided times and perhaps this is why,
                      1,500 years later, he still seems to dominate them.

                - for me
                    - Kant's grappling with two moral traditions at once
                        - the one receding
                        - the other advancing
                    - gives him that same kind of prominence where he stands
                        - witness to diverging currents of thought
                        - on the high ground of the Enlightenment
                - interestingly he|Kant claims that the inspiration for his "kingdom of ends"
                  came from Augustine's City of God

                    - a title that, like its author, straddles two ages
                - Kant's varied formulations of the "moral law" embrace a similar tension [4:436]
