        The two principles are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate personal action to an ultimate end</dd>
        <dt><dfn>M2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        Personally, for my part, I take these to be sufficient moral principles.
        Whatever obeys them, I judge to be right; whatever counters them, wrong.
        Right (in the moral sense, viz. what ought to be) consists in obedience to both principles together,
        while wrong consists in countering either, or both.
        Whatever neither obeys nor counters, I judge to be neither right nor wrong.
        </p>
    <p>
        For your part, you might easily conclude that M1 and M2 are insufficient or even unnecessary
        for moral judgement.  I won’t try to convince you otherwise in this short treatise.
        While I continue to call them ‘moral’ principles, my only intended claim is that both
        are well derived from their postulates.  I constrain my argument to supporting this claim.

        <dd>I value reason the most</dd>

                - lack of ultimate purpose threatens to undo reason at the practical end, and unravel it
                    - leaving me with unreason, which (by P2) I fear
                - but that ultimate purpose needs rational being to eventually discover (or create) it
                - and needs *endless continuity* of rational being to carry that purpose

                    - and test it against all eventualities
            - forestalling objection that reason *has* no forward direction and purpose is illusion:
                - Kant's insight that freedom is subjectively necessary to reason
                  despite its objective impossibility in nature [4:446-63]
                    ' Reason must view herself as the authoress of her principles, independently of
                      alien influences, and must consequently, as practical reason, or as the will
                      of a rational being, by herself be viewed as free...  From this stem all
                      judgements about actions such that they *ought* to have been *done* even
                      if they *were not done*." [4:448, 55]

    <p>
        Now I ask you to imagine a corresponding practice.
        Therefore suppose that M1 and M2 are realized and introduced to modern society.
        Suppose they become integral to its structure.  Whether by custom, foundational myth,
        institution or device, their effects (imagine) are made pervasive, strong and durable.
        They become a major part of the social fabric.
        </p>
    <p>
        Elsewhere I argue for the feasibility of such an introduction.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#AF' id='AF-a'>AF</a>]</sup>
        Here I argue only for its fitness.
        I claim that M1 and M2 together fit the purpose of M0 exactly.
        Like a perfectly tailored suit of formal wear, nothing remains to be cut
        and no obvious alteration would improve|better the fit.  (And it beats going naked.)
        This cannot prove that it’s the best possible suit [to wear] for the occaision.
        Other combinations of formal principles might fit the purpose
        ([in the sense of] defying any easy alteration) and one might even fit better.
        …<pre>
            - footnote to further illustrate mode of argument
                - metaphor of fitness landscape
                - hills (fit) and valleys (unfit)
                - argument tells that form is hill
                    - not that form is only hill (the only fit form) nor tallest hill (the best fit)
            </pre>…
        I have no proof against that possibility.
        But here I have a combination that’s ready to wear and fits exactly,
        and I base my argument on a demonstration of this.

            but sometimes I reflect on the origin of the formal principles.
            I think history must have given me M2.  It’s explicit in modern society.
            I could almost copy it verbatim.
            <p>
                I could get M1 too from history
                if I were to analyze the religious roots and utopian tradition of my culture.
                In fact I got it by analyzing M0.  Cutting away its particulars
                I uncovered an M1-like form.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#MF' id='MF-a'>MF</a>]</sup>
                So it was a late discovery; I never thought before to cut the traditional material in this way.
