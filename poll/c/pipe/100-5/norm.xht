        The principles are imperative in form:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate personal action to an ultimate end</dd>
        <dt><dfn>M2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        I take these principles to be sufficient for moral judgement.
        I judge what obeys them to be right; what counters them, wrong.
        Right (viz. what ought to be) consists in obedience to both M1 and M2 together,
        while wrong consists in countering either, or both.
        What neither obeys nor counters I judge neither right nor wrong.
        But here I will not attempt to advance this general claim.<sup class='ref'><a href='#SC' id='SC-a'>SC</a></sup>
        Here I only intend to convince you that these principles are well grounded in their premises
        and useful in designing real structures.
        </p>
    <p>
        The premises are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>I value reason above all <sup class='ref'><a href='#PR' id='PR-a'>PR</a></sup></dd>
        </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>I think that all communications are limited to light speed</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
         Even the most urgent of news cannot travel very quickly through the stars.
         But sometimes a limitation is a good thing, especially in human affairs.
         The philosopher and historian of ideas, Isaiah Berlin, who was much concerned
         with political ethics and the dangers of violence in pursuing collective ends,
         once recommended that the best we might hope for is some kind of limiting arrangement
         that served to protect “differing groups of human beings — at the very least to prevent them
         from attempting to exterminate each other, and, so far as possible, to prevent them
         from hurting each other”.<sup class='ref'><a href='#Ber78' id='Ber78p50'>Ber78</a></sup>
        </p>

        A grand-scale version of this safeguard is already offered in the limit of light speed.

            This unlikely conjunction of astrophysics and ethics is paralleled
            in Kant’s humble confession|disclosure, later quoted as his epitaph:
            “Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence,
            the more often and more steadily one reflects on them:
            the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.” —

            Not being a trained philosopher, but respectful of Kant, I wish to avoid

            At the same time, as an engineer,
            I cannot see how to apply the moral law “cleansed of everything empirical”
            except by reformulating it through the introduction of an empirically grounded physics (P3).
            So I reformulate it (M1, M2) but restrict the scope of my claims for the result.
