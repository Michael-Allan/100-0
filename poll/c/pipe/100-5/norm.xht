        The principles are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>M1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Relate personal action to an ultimate end</dd>
        <dt><dfn>M2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Promote a maximum, universal sum of personal freedom</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        For my part, I take these two principles to be sufficient for moral judgement.
        Whatever obeys them, I judge to be right; whatever counters them, wrong.
        Right (viz. what ought to be) consists in obedience to both principles together,
        while wrong consists in countering either, or both.
        That which neither obeys nor counters, I judge to be neither right nor wrong.
        </p>
    <p>
        But I will not advance a general claim of completeness here.
        Here I intend only to convince you that M1 and M2 are well fitted to their postulates
        and useful for structural purposes.  People can build sturdy things with them.
        </p>
    <p>
        The postulates are:
        </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P1</dfn></dt>
        <dd>I value reason the most</dd>
        </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>P2</dfn></dt>
        <dd>I think that all communications are limited to light speed</dd>
        </dl>
    <p>
        I value reason for its steadfast work.
        It labours to find meaning and coherence in the universe of experience,
        trying hard to fit each effect with its cause, and each means with its end.
        It labours unswervingly, never turns back, and given the opportunity will always make progress.
        This I can rely on.
        </p>
    <p>
        I can also share in it.  I can experience reason working in me.
        I can even, on occaision, “triumph o’er a secret wrung from nature’s close reserve”.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Bro55' id='Bro55qTG'>Bro55</a>]</sup>
        This makes me grateful to those in the past who carried reason forward,
        and hopeful for those in the future who may carry it further.
        </p>

        Even the most urgent of news cannot travel very quickly through the stars.
        There is a limit and sometimes a limit is a good thing, especially in human affairs.

        I could also get M1 from history if I were to analyze the religious, utopian tradition of my culture.
        In fact I got it by analyzing M0.  Cutting away its particulars
        (or those of the traditional material, either way)
        uncovers an M1-like form.<sup class='ref'>[<a href='#MF' id='MF-a'>MF</a>]</sup>

            This unlikely juxtaposition of physics and ethics brings to mind Kant’s intimation,
            later quoted as his epitaph,
            “Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence,
            the more often and more steadily one reflects on them:
            the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.” <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan88' id='Kan88q5:161'>Kan88</a>]</sup>

            This fashion of relating matter and form was suggested by my reading of Kant’s <i>Groundwork</i>.
            “All rational cognition is either <i>material</i> and considers some object,
            or <i>formal</i> and occupied merely with the form of the understanding and of reason itself,
            and with the universal rules of thinking as such, regardless of differences among its objects.” <sup class='ref'>[<a href='#Kan85' id='Kan85q4:387'>Kan85</a>]</sup>
