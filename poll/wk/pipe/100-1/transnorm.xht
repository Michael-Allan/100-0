                - where a given intermediate means (step in way) happens to be substantially shared

                    - by rival groups of actors

                - why
                    - consensus is far more elusive than we typically foresee and allow for
                    - it will be scarce, shifting and short lived even at the way extremities
                        - ultimate ends always being frayed to the smallest detail at the leaves
                        - actor groups being somewhat frayed
                            - but at times completely dissolving or shifting
                                - and reforming
                                - as the larger enactive power structure reforms
                    - crucial to make the most of consensus where and when it happens

                - to be decorated only later by functional clothes
                - else the initial design will overtask me

                    - easy to shape

                                - because it'll be more immediate than a graphical one
                                    - a better, less problematic fit with the underlying HTML of the wayrepo
