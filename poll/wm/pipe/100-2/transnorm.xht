            - archiving the old unchanged as a stable reference
            - moving namespace 'waymaker' → 'waycaster'
                - to avoid confusion during the transition

                - e.g. first it must pull *me* through 1 and 2 below
            - ensuring the overall plan is compatible with this outline:
                1. ensure that an entrance at least is built
                    - to implement the "start" function whose discovery moved me from Votorola to Waymaker
                2. present the larger, unfinished structure to engineers
                    | let them confront it unaided
                    | ensure that the entrance opens to an empty hall
                        - a space to attach facilities that are mostly un-invented yet
                3. pull engineers through 1 into 2
                4. ensure the engagement of enough engineers to carry on without me
