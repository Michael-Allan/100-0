    - action cues in overguide UI
        ( as per notebook 2015.7.3
        - from norms decided by elected officials (laws, ministerial plans, etc) to election
            - lines "lit up" where a shift of one's electoral vote would help to execute the norm
        - from all norms to executive
            - rightward lines show amount of executive recognition on offer
            - so one can seek executive branches that need help
    - getting a demo of the UI published ASAP
        ( personal need

            - end (poll/1)
        = code overguideway web API
            - just enough to form the empty, unadjusted cache from that source
        = code overguideway count
            - based on a copy of my overrepo alone
        = test maintenance of consistency between count and precount
